## **Task 0**
Git and GitHub were absolutely new to me. But now I am so impressed by the power of such a great developer tool, that I try to encourage all my friends to start learning it.  
Everything was new to me, therefore every subsequent command surprised me a lot).  
I am 100% sure that I will use Git and GitHub almost every day on my future developer job!

## **Task 1**
I've learned a lot of shell commands. I've also mastered the besics of Linux Filesystem. Material was new, but quite easy to understand.  
The only thing that wasn't easy to overcome for me was installing virtual linux box using vagrant. It took me 1 day searching for answers to solve errors that happend while vagrant up'ing:) Finally, I've got it!

## **Task 2**
1.What is Version Control
Despite a lot of similar material from Task 0 this course was very informative and constructive. It made my basic knowledge of Git much stronger through repeating fundamental consepts. Anyway, there were some new information and Git commands, such as what hidden .git file contains, power of git log with tons of flags(-p --stat --oneline ...), usage of .gitignore file, git tag to add labels to commits and the power of undoing things with reset, revert and git commit --amend.

2.GitHub & Collaboration
Exactly as with the previous course this course just reminded me how to use GitHub, but it also gave me some knew skills in reviewing existing works and commits, creating and reading issues and showed me the rebase power.

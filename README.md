Git and GitHub were absolutely new to me. But now I am so impressed by the power of such a great developer tool, that I try to encourage all my friends to start learning it.  
Everything was new to me, therefore every subsequent command surprised me a lot).  
I am 100% sure that I will use Git and GitHub almost every day on my future developer job!

## **Task 1**
I've learned a lot of shell commands. I've also mastered the besics of Linux Filesystem. Material was new, but quite easy to understand.  
The only thing that wasn't easy to overcome for me was installing virtual linux box using vagrant. It took me 1 day searching for answers to solve errors that happend while vagrant up'ing:) Finally, I've got it!

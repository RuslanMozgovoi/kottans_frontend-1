Git and GitHub were absolutely new to me. But now I am so impressed by the power of such a great developer tool, that I try to encourage all my friends to start learning it.  
Everything was new to me, therefore every subsequent command surprised me a lot).  
I am 100% sure that I will use Git and GitHub almost every day on my future developer job!
